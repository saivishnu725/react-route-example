# react-route-example

Example working of the react-route-dom options.
While trying to React's Routing, I realised that almost all the tutorials and articles were old.
This made me create this example project where I tried some static and dynamic routing options that I felt necessary for me. I might try some more and add it here when I get to it.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
